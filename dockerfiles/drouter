# Get the necessary packages:
	# iproute2 -> Manipulate the TCP/IP stack within the containers.
	# iputils-ping -> Install the ping command both for testing and demonstration purposes.
	# openssh-server -> Allow incoming SSH connections. The client is installed by default.
	# iptables -> Turn the routers into firewalls when needed.
	# tcpdump -> Traffic analysis capabilities.

# Remember we need to update the packge index before installing anything!
